# Bor Protocol

_Powering autonomous AI livestreamer agents_


## Overview
Bor Protocol is a comprehensive platform for creating and managing autonomous AI livestreamer agents on X. The project consists of multiple components working together to deliver an immersive streaming experience, powered by the Eliza AI framework. The system enables AI agents to interact with viewers in real-time through various social platforms while maintaining engaging 3D visual presence.

# Project Components

## 1. Bor UI (Frontend)
A modern web-based application that serves as the visual interface for the AI agent:

#### Core Technologies
- React 18 + TypeScript for robust type-safe development
- Three.js and @react-three/fiber for 3D rendering
- Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- Tailwind CSS for responsive styling

#### Key Features
- Real-time 3D character rendering and animation
- WebGL-powered visual effects
- Integrated chat display and interaction

#### Scene Configuration
- Customizable 3D environments
- Dynamic lighting and camera systems
- Background music and sound effect management

## 2. Chrome Extension
A specialized browser extension for capturing live stream interactions on Twitter: 
There is no API endpoint for video livestreaming on X. That's why we created a special browser plugin to capture the live chat messages.

#### Core Features
- Real-time chat monitoring and filtering
- Message queuing and processing
- Duplicate detection and filtering
- Local storage for offline capability

#### Technical Implementation
- Background service worker for continuous monitoring
- Message transformation and normalization
- WebSocket integration for real-time communication
- Rate limiting and throttling mechanisms

## 3. Backend Server
A Node.js-based backend service orchestrating the entire system:

#### Core Services
- WebSocket server for real-time communication
- RESTful API endpoints for system management
- Stream state management
- User session handling
- Database operations

#### Technical Features
- Horizontal scaling support
- Message queue implementation
- Rate limiting and security measures
- Error handling and logging
- Performance monitoring

#### API Endpoints
```
Stream Management:
GET    /api/streams           # List active streams
POST   /api/streams           # Create new stream
PUT    /api/streams/:id       # Update stream config
DELETE /api/streams/:id       # End stream

User Management:
GET    /api/users/:id         # Get user profile
POST   /api/users             # Create user
PUT    /api/users/:id         # Update user

Interaction Endpoints:
POST   /api/messages          # Send message
GET    /api/messages/:roomId  # Get room messages
POST   /api/reactions         # Send reaction
```

## 4. Eliza AI Framework / client-borp
The core AI engine powering the autonomous agents:
We created our own client in the ELiza framework called bor-client that enables the connection to the 3d UI and the backend server.
The bor-client is responsible for generating:
- Fresh thoughts
- Responding and interacting with chat: Respond with a message and an action (animation)
- Generating periodic animaions for the stream

#### Core Capabilities
- Context-aware response generation
- Memory management and retrieval
- Action system for custom behaviors

#### AI Model Integration
- Multiple model support with fallback
- Context window management
- Response formatting and filtering


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 23+ (required for modern JavaScript features)
- pnpm (for efficient package management)
- MongoDB 6.0+ (for data persistence)
- Chrome Browser 91+ (for extension)
- Bun 1.0+ (for server-side JavaScript runtime)
- API keys for text generation (openai, anthropic...) + Elevenlabs
- Bunny.net account for media storage
- GPU with CUDA support (optional, for local AI models)

### Detailed Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
